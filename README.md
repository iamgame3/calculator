# Calculator Project
This project is another test of my JS, DOM manipulation, CSS, and HTML skills. This is also the final JS project of the foundations section on TOP!

This calculator does not work exactly like a normal calculator. For example, you can only evaluate two numbers at once. You can't do 3 + 9 - 4 in one calculation, you have to do 3 + 9, then use the sum of that in the next step, which would be 12 - 4. There are a few other differences but they are very minor.
